# How-to-Fly-Into-Space

A penguin has hopes of some day being able to fly into space. He is a brilliant engineer with one goal: GO TO THE MOON.

He watches a television ad that states that they will give someone a chance to ride a rocket ship.
However, his dreams are crushed when they mention that penguins are not allowed. The penguin is outraged. The penguin builds
himself a jetpack and on himself, a few augmentations. He sets himself for flight, and reaches the stars!

To play, you must tap left and right. Navigate by jumping on the clouds and do not fall. The goal is to aim high!
